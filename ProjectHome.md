This tool allows you to select specific columns, query for the result set and move the data to another database platform. You can query data from an ODBC connection and place the new table in another table on a different ODBC connection or a jdbc connection. Move data from a Derby database to an Oracle database for example. The project will allow you to define what jdbc drivers you have.
